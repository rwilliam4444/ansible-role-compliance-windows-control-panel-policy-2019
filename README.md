# Role Name:
- ansible-role-compliance-windows-control-panel-policy-2019

# Description:
This Control Panel Policy Role was based off the CIS specs for 2019 servers.   
This role covers the "Control Panel" CIS section only. The checks and
remediation commands are for local settings only. Group Policy settings may
override these settings. When the "remediate" variable is set to "YES", the
role will try to remediate the server's setting(s) according to the CIS
standards.   The defaults/main.yml file can be used to disable specific CIS
items (i.e. "execute_<cis task #>") from executing. The default value in the
defaults/main.yml for these CIS item variables (i.e. "execute_<cis task #>")
is set to "YES". The value "YES" means that the CIS item will execute at run
time. Set the value to "NO" if you want to skip this CIS item in question from
executing.
